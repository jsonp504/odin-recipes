# odin-recipes

First project on Odin

This project will include creating a basic recipe website using
the HTML knowledge obtained thru the first few lessons on Odin

Created a homepage for basic recipe website that includes three separate links to different recipes.
Within those separate links are recipes that include a picture of the final product, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered steps list.
